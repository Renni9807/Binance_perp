# Backtest Visualization Module

This module provides various functions for visualizing backtest results.

## Installation

1. Save the `visualizer.py` file in the same directory as your backtest code.
2. Update the `main` function in your `backtest.py` file with the provided code, or add only the necessary sections.

## Key Features

### 1. Equity Curve Visualization
```python
visualize_equity_curve(backtester, title="Equity Curve", save_path=None)
```
- Displays a graph showing account balance changes during the backtest period.
- Saves the image file if `save_path` is set.

### 2. Trade Results Visualization
```python
visualize_trade_results(backtester, title="Trade Results", save_path=None)
```
- Displays cumulative profits and individual trade profits/losses as a graph.
- Profitable trades are shown in green, losses in red.

### 3. Trade Pattern Analysis
```python
visualize_trade_patterns(backtester, title="Trade Patterns Analysis", save_path=None)
```
- Analyzes and displays average profit and win rate by pattern.
- Helps identify which patterns are most effective.

### 4. Backtest Results Comparison
```python
compare_backtest_results(in_sample_stats, out_sample_stats, metrics=None, title="Backtest Results Comparison", save_path=None)
```
- Creates bar graphs comparing in-sample and out-of-sample results side by side.
- Allows selecting which metrics to compare with the `metrics` parameter.

### 5. Complete Results Visualization
```python
visualize_all_results(backtester1, backtester2=None, period1_name="In-Sample", period2_name="Out-of-Sample", output_dir="./results")
```
- Runs all visualizations at once and saves the results.
- Includes comparative analysis for comprehensive results.

## Current System Implementation

### Stop Loss Mechanism
The current system implements a fixed-percentage stop loss strategy:

```python
def calculate_stop_loss(self, candle, position_type):
    """Calculate stop loss level based on candle properties."""
    if position_type == 'buy':
        return float(candle['low']) * 0.995  # 0.5% below low
    else:
        return float(candle['high']) * 1.005  # 0.5% above high
```

**Key points about the current approach:**
- For long positions: Stop loss is set at 0.5% below the candle's low price
- For short positions: Stop loss is set at 0.5% above the candle's high price
- Once price hits this level, the position is automatically liquidated to limit losses
- This provides a simple yet effective risk management method by establishing a maximum potential loss for each trade
- The fixed percentage approach is applied regardless of market volatility

## Future Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Stop Loss Enhancement
While the current fixed-percentage stop loss works as a basic risk management tool, it could be enhanced with:

- **Volatility-adjusted stop loss**: Calculate stop loss distances based on recent market volatility (e.g., ATR - Average True Range)
- **Adaptive positioning**: Adjust position size inversely to stop loss distance to maintain consistent risk per trade
- **Trailing stop mechanisms**: Move stop loss levels to lock in profits as the trade moves favorably
- **Time-based stop loss**: Exit trades that haven't performed as expected within a certain timeframe

Example implementation concept for volatility-adjusted stops:
```python
def calculate_dynamic_stop_loss(self, candle, position_type, atr_periods=14, atr_multiplier=2.0):
    # Calculate ATR
    atr_value = self.calculate_atr(atr_periods)
    
    if position_type == 'buy':
        return float(candle['close']) - (atr_value * atr_multiplier)
    else:
        return float(candle['close']) + (atr_value * atr_multiplier)
```

### 2. Daily Candle-Based Market Direction Analysis
A promising enhancement would be integrating daily timeframe analysis to determine market bias. By analyzing daily candles in real-time, the system could identify whether the market is bullish or bearish, which could significantly improve trading direction selection (long vs. short positions).

This approach would:
- Align short-term trading strategies with the broader market trend
- Filter out potential false signals that go against the dominant trend
- Optimize entry points by considering higher timeframe support/resistance levels
- Potentially reduce drawdowns by avoiding countertrend trades

### 3. Additional Enhancement Ideas

#### Advanced Market Analysis
- Multi-timeframe analysis to strengthen signal validation
- Volume profile analysis to identify key price levels
- Market regime detection (trending vs. ranging)
- Volatility filtering to adapt to changing market conditions

#### Performance Optimization
- Dynamic position sizing based on volatility and conviction
- Adaptive parameter optimization based on market conditions
- Machine learning models for pattern recognition and prediction
- Integration with market sentiment analysis from external sources

## Important Notes

- All visualization functions use `matplotlib`. This library must be installed.
- You need write permissions in the directory to save visualization results.
- Be mindful of memory usage when visualizing large amounts of data.
